      CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets, and is the preferred way for
      setting the look and feel of a website. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a
      markup language responsible for how your web pages will look like. It
      controls the colors, fonts, and layouts of your website elements.This
      style sheet language also allows you to add effects or animations to your
      website. You can use it to display some CSS animations like click button
      effects, spinners or loaders, and animated backgrounds. Without CSS, your
      website will appear as a plain HTML page.The cascading means that a style
      applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements
      within the parent. For example, setting the colour of body text will mean
      all headings and paragraphs within the body will also be the same colour.
