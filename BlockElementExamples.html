        This is the first paragraph in the example about the P tag. There really
        isn't much to say here.

      <p style="text-align: center;">
        This is the second paragraph. Again, more of the same. This time the
        paragraph is aligned in the center. This might not be such a good idea as
        it makes the text hard to read.
      </p>
      <HR>
      <p style="text-align: right;">
        Here the paragraph is aligned to the right. Right-aligned text is also
        troublesome to read. The rest of the text of this paragraph is of little
        importance.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Under HTML 4.0-compliant browsers, you are able to justify text. As you
        may notice, the way browsers tend to justify text is sometimes imprecise.
        Furthermore, not all browsers support this attribute value.

        <blockquote>
            Browsers generally render blockquote text as indented text. If your
     quoted text needs to display within a non-quoted paragraph, you should use the
     HTML q tag. Most browsers surround q text with quotation marks.
